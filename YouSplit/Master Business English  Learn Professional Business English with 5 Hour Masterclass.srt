presented an alternative analysis that

660
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,800
showed a more moderate growth

661
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,040
scenario based on my findings the

662
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,960
management decided to proceed with a

663
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,359
scaled down investment which ultimately

664
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,400

example

770
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,000
phrases our main priority is securing a

776
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:04,599

willing to offer a 5% discount on bulk

783
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,760
orders let's try a different phrase

784
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,119
we appreciate your offer but we need a

785
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,119
more flexible payment schedule to

786
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,400
proceed let's move on to clarifying and

787
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,319
confirming terms this process is all

788
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,960
about ensuring both parties understand

789
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:49,640

00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,440
begins in the second quarter correct

794
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,599
to confirm both parties are in agreement

795
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,160
on the revised terms of

very clear on the details of the

799
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,960
agreement in our next section handling

if a party has an issue with one of the

803
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,559
terms or conditions you could say I

resources or how about while I see your

808

832
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,559

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,200
business providing a solution or an

951
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,839
alternative is Key by saying let me

952
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,480
direct you to someone who can assist you

953
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,640
you're offering a constructive response

954
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,559
showing that you care about the person's

955
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,599
needs and are committed to finding help

956
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,760
for them let me direct you to someone

957
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:36,200
who can assist

958
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:39,440
you saying I'm busy right now might seem

959
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,359
abrupt instead you could try I'm

960
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,559
currently engaged in another task can we

961
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:48,319
schedule a time to discuss this by

962
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:50,880
explaining your current engagement and

963
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,799
suggesting a specific time to address

964
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,760
the issue you show that you value the

965
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:58,599
person's concern while managing your

966
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,119
priorities

967
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:03,760
effectively I'm currently engaged in

968
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,359
another task can we schedule a time to

969
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,720
discuss

970
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,480
this the phrase it's not good enough can

971
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,839
sound harsh and

972
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,200
demotivating saying this needs

973
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,839
Improvement to meet our standards is

974
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,960
more constructive and sets a clear

975
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,200
expectation encouraging better

976
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:26,000
performance without being overly

977
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,640
critical this needs Improvement to meet

978
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,640
our standards

979
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,599
saying I need a raise is very direct and

980
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,079
seems a bit blunt by saying I'd like to

981
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,799
discuss my compensation based on my

982
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:45,280
performance and contributions we are

983
00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:47,839
better framing a discussion about your

984
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,240
performance and it shows you are open to

985
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:53,359
dialogue and are basing your request on

986
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,760
Merit which is more likely to be well

987
00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:00,839
received I'd like to discuss my

988
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:04,119
compensation based on my performance and

989
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:07,720
contributions saying this is a bad idea

990
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:10,440
can be discouraging instead we could say

991
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,000
I'm concerned about the potential risks

992
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,599
can we evaluate the

993
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,040
Alternatives by saying this you are

994
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,599
showing that you can consider different

995
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,160
perspectives and are willing to find the

996
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:26,000
best solution together as a

997
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:30,119
team I'm concerned about the potential

998
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,119
risks can we evaluate the

999
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,799
Alternatives saying I don't like it is

1000
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,960
subjective and

1001
00:51:36,799 --> 00:51:43,440
unhelpful instead we could say I have

1002
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,280
some reservations can we explore other

1003
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,880
options by using this phrase you are

1004
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:52,000
providing a constructive critique and

1005
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:55,040
opening the door for discussion and

1006
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,520
Improvement I have some reservations can

1007
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,520
we explore other options

1008
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:07,200
why did you do that can come across as

1009
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:09,760
accusatory instead we could say can you

1010
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,920
explain your reasoning behind this

1011
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,319
action by saying this you show that you

1012
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,160
are seeking to understand the thought

1013
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:20,480
process behind a decision which is much

1014
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,760
more respectful and

1015
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:27,000
productive can you explain your

1016
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,000
reasoning behind this action

1017
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,160
simply stating that's wrong is not

1018
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:35,960
helpful our business English

1019
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,520
transformation is there seems to be an

1020
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,119
error let's review it together in this

1021
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,440
way you are pointing out that there

1022
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,440
seems to be an error and suggesting a

1023
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,839
joint review encourages collaboration

1024
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,880
and problem

1025
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,520
solving there seems to be an error let's

1026
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,520
review it

1027
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,319
together saying I'll try can sound

1028
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:03,000
uncertain I will do my best to

1029
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:05,280
accomplish this shows commitment and

1030
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,079
confidence in your ability to complete

1031
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,640
the

1032
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:13,559
task I will do my best to accomplish

1033
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:16,359
this it's not my fault sounds like

1034
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:19,520
you're blaming others and it can create

1035
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:22,720
Conflict by saying let's identify what

1036
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,720
went wrong and how we can resolve it you

1037
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,359
are showing that you Foster a more

1038
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,079
cooperative and solution orientated

1039
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:34,079
environment let's identify what went

1040
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:38,799
wrong and how we can resolve

1041
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:42,599
it our 15th example is I need more

1042
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:45,200
time instead we could say I require

1043
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,760
additional time to complete this

1044
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,160
thoroughly requesting more time in a

1045
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,480
straightforward manner can be perceived

1046
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,880
as a lack of planning by explaining that

1047
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:59,799
additional time is needed to ensure Thor

1048
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,440
completion you emphasize your commitment

1049
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:06,400
to quality work I require additional

1050
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,480
time to complete this

1051
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,920
thoroughly saying I don't understand can

1052
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:16,400
feel abrupt it's much better to say

1053
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:18,760
could you clarify that for me asking for

1054
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,640
clarification is more polite and shows

1055
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,599
that you are actively seeking to

1056
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,079
comprehend the

1057
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:27,119
information could you clarify that for

1058
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:30,319
me

1059
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,040
next up our basic English phrase is I'll

1060
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:37,480
be late in business English we could say

1061
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,119
I may not arrive on time I'll keep you

1062
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,599
updated informing someone that you'll be

1063
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,559
late is important but adding that you'll

1064
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:47,880
keep them updated shows that you are

1065
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:50,160
considerate of their time and

1066
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,680
responsibilities I may not arrive on

1067
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,680
time I'll keep you

1068
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:01,079
updated let's move on to I'm leaving

1069
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,799
early instead we should say I need to

1070
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,240
leave early today I'll ensure all my

1071
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:08,000
tasks are

1072
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:09,640
covered when leaving early it's

1073
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
courteous to assure that your

1074
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,200
responsibilities are managed this

1075
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,160
statement shows that you are responsible

1076
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,359
and considerate of your work

1077
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,359
commitments I need to leave early today

1078
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,359
I'll ensure all my tasks are

1079
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:31,400
covered saying we can't do that shows an

1080
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,760
outright refusal and it can shut down

1081
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,319
dialogue instead we could say that may

1082
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,720
not be feasible can we consider an

1083
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,039
alternative

1084
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,920
approach by suggesting that something

1085
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,520
may not be feasible and proposing

1086
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,680
Alternatives you keep the conversation

1087
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,520
open and

1088
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:54,400
constructive that may not be feasible

1089
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,400
can we consider an alternative

1090
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:01,680
approach our basic sentence is you

1091
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:04,720
didn't tell me we will say instead in

1092
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,440
business English I wasn't informed about

1093
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,960
this can we discuss it

1094
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:13,280
now by using the basic English version

1095
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,920
you are kind of accusing someone of not

1096
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,720
informing you and it can create

1097
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,000
tension by using the business English

1098
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,880
version you can show that you are aiming

1099
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,119
to resolve the issue without assigning

1100
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:30,079
blame I wasn't informed about this can

1101
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,079
we discuss it

1102
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:38,039
now saying that's impossible can be

1103
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,119
discouraging instead you should say that

1104
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,760
seems highly challenging let's consider

1105
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,559
how we might approach it differently

1106
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,319
this phrase shows you have a willingness

1107
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,480
to find

1108
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,960
solutions that seems highly challenging

1109
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:56,960
let's consider how we might approach it

1110
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,960
differently

1111
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,319
telling someone to hurry up can be

1112
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:07,839
perceived as rude instead we could say

1113
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:11,280
could you expedite this process this is

1114
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:15,880
much more polite and maintains

00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,880
professionalism could you expedite this

00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:23,520
process stop bothering me is dismissive

1117

and rude instead we could say could you

1118
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:30,760
please address this later this is more

1119
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:34,480

later saying this is boring can be

demotivating instead say this could be

1123
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:49,200
more engaging can we make some

1124
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:52,880
adjustments this phrase comes across as

1125
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:55,720
being constructive and encouraging of

1126
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,319
improvement this could be more engaging

1127
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,640
can we make some

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,599

made a mistake but in a business sense

1136
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,440
it's better to say I need to correct an

1137
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,599
error let's address it together this

1138
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,960
shows teamwork and a commitment to

1139
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,000
resolving issues

1140
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:39,680
collaboratively I need to correct an

1141
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,960
error let's address it

1142
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,079
together saying it's too expensive can

1143
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,760
sound

1144
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,839
blunt instead we should say this exceeds

1145
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,520
our budget can we explore more coste

1146
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:55,359
effective

1147
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:58,039
options this phrase shows Financial

1148
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:01,039
prudence and problem

1149
00:58:58,039 --> 00:59:05,039
solving this exceeds our budget can we

1150
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,039
explore more coste effective

1151
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:13,160
options saying I need help might seem

1152
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:16,280
abrupt instead we should say could you

1153
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:19,240
assist me with this task this is more

1154
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,799
polite and specific which is appreciated

1155
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,240
in a business

1156
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:26,520
environment could you assist me with

1157
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,520
this task

1158
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,880
admitting forgetfulness with I forgot

1159
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,680
might come across as

1160
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:37,520
careless instead you should say it

1161
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:40,400
slipped my mind I apologize for the

1162
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,359
oversight this shows being able to take

1163
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,920
responsibility and a commitment to

1164
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:48,920
making things right it slipped my mind I

1165
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,920
apologize for the

1166
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:56,359
oversight saying it's not ready can

1167
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,200
sound unprepared instead you should say

1168
00:59:56,359 --> 01:00:02,079
this is still in progress I will inform

1169
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,079
you once it's complete this sentence

1170
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,319
shows that you are actively working on

1171
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,280
something and you're managing someone

1172
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:11,359
else's

1173
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:14,760
expectations this is still in progress I

1174
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,760
will inform you once it's

1175
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:22,400
complete next up let's change the basic

1176
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:25,039
English phrase I can't make it to I

1177
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,880
won't be able to attend can we

1178
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,920
reschedule

1179
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,799
informing someone that you can't attend

1180
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,000
is necessary but offering to reschedule

1181
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:37,039
shows that you value the commitment and

1182
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:41,200
are looking for a way to make it work I

1183
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,200
won't be able to attend can we

1184
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:48,480
reschedule while that's great is

1185
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:51,640
positive this is excellent work is more

1186
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:53,480
specific and gives clearer recognition

1187
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,920
of effort and

1188
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,920
achievement this is excellent work

1189
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,480
saying I'm sorry is often enough but in

1190
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:08,880
a business context saying I apologize

1191
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:11,520
for any inconvenience cause shows a more

1192
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:17,240
formal acknowledgment of the

1193
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:17,240
impact I apologize for any inconvenience

1194
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:24,039
caused saying no problem is

1195
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,160
informal instead we should say it's not

1196
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:29,119
an issue this is more more professional

1197
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,119
and it reassures someone that their

1198
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:34,760
request or action is

1199
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,760
acceptable it's not an

1200
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,520
issue suggesting a meeting with let's

1201
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,599
meet can seem

1202
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:46,359
informal can we schedule a meeting is

1203
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,359
more professional and indicates respect

1204
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:52,680
for the other person's

1205
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:52,680
time can we schedule a

1206
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:59,960
meeting while you're welcome is very

1207
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:02,599
polite it was my pleasure as a touch of

1208
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,119
formality and warmth which is often

1209
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:08,559
appreciated in business

1210
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:11,599
Communications it was my

1211
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:15,279
pleasure thanks is casual and can be

1212
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:18,799
seen as less sincere thank you very much

1213
01:02:15,279 --> 01:02:22,400
is more formal and expresses greater

1214
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:25,559
appreciation thank you very

1215
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,440
much saying I don't agree is quite

1216
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,640
Direct

1217
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:32,240
and might lead to conflict instead we

1218
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:35,839
could say I have a different perspective

1219
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:40,039
on the matter by saying this you are

1220
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:42,720
allowing for a more open and respectful

1221
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:44,640
dialogue I have a different perspective

1222
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,000
on this

1223
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:52,640
matter saying this is urgent is direct

1224
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,279
but can create unnecessary stress this

1225
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,599
requires immediate attention is a more

1226
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:59,480
professional way to convey urgency

1227
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:03,559
without sounding

1228
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:06,760
alarmist this requires immediate

1229
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:09,960
attention saying it's too late is very

1230
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:12,400
final and can close off discussion

1231
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,599
instead we could say we missed the

1232
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:17,520
deadline let's evaluate our options this

1233
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,039
phrase comes across as being more

1234
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,880
constructive and solution oriented we

1235
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,200
missed the deadline let's evaluate our

1236
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,720
options

1237
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,319
saying I'm not interested can come

1238
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,359
across as

1239
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:35,839
dismissive instead you should say I

1240
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:39,079
don't see the value in this at the

1241
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:42,160
moment by saying this you leave room for

1242
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:46,440
further discussion if the situation

1243
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:50,599
changes I don't see value in this at the

1244
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:53,799
moment our next basic English phrase is

1245
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:56,480
what's the point this can come across as

1246
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:59,559
cynical or dismissive

1247
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,760
instead you should say could you explain

1248
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:07,119
the purpose behind this this phrase is

1249
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:09,279
more respectful and encourages a clearer

1250
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,160
understanding could you explain the

1251
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:12,160
purpose behind

1252
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:19,079
this while good job is positive well

1253
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,400
done is slightly more formal and can

1254
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:27,079
convey greater sincerity in

1255
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:30,000
acknowledging someone's work well done

1256
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:33,279
I'm on it is casual and can be

1257
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,079
interpreted as less committed I'm

1258
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:37,839
handling it now is more formal and

1259
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:43,079
indicates that you are actively

1260
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:47,760
addressing the task I'm handling it

1261
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:50,279
now can you wait sounds abrupt and rude

1262
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,720
could you please hold on for a moment is

1263
01:04:50,279 --> 01:04:55,720
more polite and shows respect for the

1264
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:58,359
other person's time could you please

1265
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:02,039
please hold on for a

1266
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:05,520
moment saying this is a mess can seem

1267
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:08,640
overly critical in business English we

1268
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:11,119
would say this needs significant

1269
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,520
Improvement this is more constructive

1270
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:17,680
and focuses on the action needed this

1271
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:20,960
needs significant

1272
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:24,640
Improvement I'm done in sound informal

1273
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:27,720
and rushed instead I have completed the

1274
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,279
task is more formal and provides clear

1275
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:34,359
communication about the work that is

1276
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:37,520
finished I have completed the

1277
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:38,839
task telling someone you're wrong is

1278
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,160
quite

1279
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:43,880
confrontational saying I believe there

1280
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:47,599
might be a misunderstanding is much more

1281
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:51,880
diplomatic and opens the door for

1282
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,880
clarification I believe there might be a

1283
01:05:52,839 --> 01:05:57,240
misunderstanding saying that's not true

1284
01:05:55,799 --> 01:06:00,640
can sound

1285
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:02,240
accusatory instead you should say I

1286
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,200
think there's some

1287
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,359
misinformation this is more tactful and

1288
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,480
less likely to cause offense I think

1289
01:06:08,359 --> 01:06:12,680
there's some

1290
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,279
misinformation and can you believe we're

1291
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:19,200
already on our 50th and final phrase

1292
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:22,039
let's go is informal that might seem a

1293
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:25,720
bit too casual in a business setting

1294
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:28,039
instead you should say let's proceed

1295
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:32,200
this is much more professional and

1296
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:32,200
conveys the same sense of moving

1297
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,279
forward these examples highlight the

1298
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:40,839
importance of being polite proactive and

1299
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:43,359
solution oriented in a business

1300
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:46,119

experienced in our next section

2024
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:24,480
explaining policies and procedures our

2025
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:27,320
list list of phrases is something that

2026
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:31,840
you can use to integrate them with your

2027
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:31,840
company's specific policies and

2028
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:40,119
procedures so let's take a look at the

2029
01:52:35,079 --> 01:52:43,079
first phrase our policy states

2030
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:46,679
that so I'll give you an example for

2031
01:52:43,079 --> 01:52:50,400
this first phrase our policy states that

2032
01:52:46,679 --> 01:52:53,400

2035
01:52:56,360 --> 01:53:03,360
a particular rule to a

2036
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:05,719

02:06:03,559 --> 02:06:06,599
Association let's take a look at our

2256
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:09,960
example

2257
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:11,360
sentence their headquarters are located

Paris their headquarters are located in

2260
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:23,280
Paris okay it's time to move on to our

2261
02:06:20,599 --> 02:06:26,040
next word which is

2262
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,840
agenda this common noun has a few

2263
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:31,239
different meanings so let's run through

2264
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:33,280
them our first definition of agenda is a

2265
02:06:31,239 --> 02:06:35,960
list of items to be discussed at a

2266
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:39,719
formal meeting so it can be an actual

2267
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:42,599
physical list we could say we have many

2268
02:06:39,719 --> 02:06:46,119
things on the agenda for today's

2269
02:06:42,599 --> 02:06:48,760
meeting our next definition of agenda is

2270
02:06:46,119 --> 02:06:51,599
a plan of things to be done or problems

2271
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:53,440
to be addressed so it's more like a

2272
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:56,639
General plan for the short to

2273
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:59,520
medium-term Future our agenda for the

2274
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:01,960
next few months is to hire some new

2275
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,679
people and our final definition of

2276
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:07,960
agenda is the underlying intentions or

2277
02:07:04,679 --> 02:07:10,719
motives of a particular person or group

2278
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:13,599
and our final sentence example is his

2279
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:16,000
agenda for the company seems to be very

2280
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:18,400
reasonable so with this definition it's

2281
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,119
more like a personal plan that someone

2282
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:24,760

02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:42,320
in the spelling between British and

2499
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:06,000
example the company added a new Clause

2500
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:10,840
to the contract which is very unfair up

2501
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:16,639

2506
02:18:26,599 --> 02:18:31,080

2507
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:33,679

repeat after me void

2514
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:55,240

legally binding or something that is

2516
02:18:55,240 --> 02:19:02,599
completely empty so null and void is

2517
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:05,439
quite a negative phrase our example

2518
02:19:02,599 --> 02:19:07,960

the

2810
02:33:52,200 --> 02:33:59,160
room this means an obvious problem or

2811
02:33:55,560 --> 02:34:02,439
controversial issue that no one wants to

2812
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:04,800
discuss our example in conversation is

2813
02:34:02,439 --> 02:34:06,760
the office was uncomfortable today

2814
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:08,359
because nobody wants to talk about the

2815
02:34:06,760 --> 02:34:10,600
elephant in the

2816
02:34:08,359 --> 02:34:14,279
room next up we have something that

2817
02:34:10,600 --> 02:34:17,720
sounds painful to twist someone's

2818
02:34:14,279 --> 02:34:20,040
arm this means to convince someone to do

2819
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:24,120
something that he or she does does not

2820
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:26,880
want to do our exampling conversation is

2821
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:30,120
I'm going to have to twist Mary's arm

2822
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:33,560
because I need her to work at the

2823
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:36,760
weekend our next idiom is to take the

2824
02:34:33,560 --> 02:34:39,520
bull by the horns and this means to

2825
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:42,680
directly confront a difficult situation

2826
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:45,800
in A Brave and determined way our

2827
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:48,880
example is we will have to tackle this

2828
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:50,680
difficult situation and take the bull by

2829
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:54,920
the horns

2830
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:57,760
our final idiom for this episode is red

2831
02:34:54,920 --> 02:35:01,080
tape and this relates to official rules

2832
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:04,359
and processes that seem excessive and

2833
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:06,720
unnecessary and our final example is we

2834
02:35:04,359 --> 02:35:09,040
wanted to expand the business into the

2835
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:11,710

2836
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:18,720

2927
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:18,160
asked if I could make a video on crime

2928
02:42:14,720 --> 02:42:21,000
vocabulary and I am very happy to oblige

2929
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:23,520
this is a huge complex field of English

2930
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,240
which will involve not one or two videos

2931
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:29,040
but probably an entirely new playlist so

2932
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:31,000
thank you may Mustafa for the suggestion

2933
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:33,920

2941
02:42:48,279 --> 02:42:52,560
to note before we begin definitions in

down these two different words to

2948
02:43:05,560 --> 02:43:11,640

02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:13,640
is an assault is an attempt or threat to

2950
02:43:11,640 --> 02:43:16,880

2956
02:43:27,319 --> 02:43:34,160

this verb arrest and this means to seize

2960
02:43:40,200 --> 02:43:44,720

2968
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:08,120
factors that raise an assault to the

02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:11,279
aggravated level typically include the

2970
02:44:08,120 --> 02:44:13,880

2971
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:17,120
the intent of the perpetrator and the

2972
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:20,120
degree of injury caused let's take a

2973
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:23,040
look at an example sentence he was

2974
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:26,680

synonyms of the word help and the

2979
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:41,359
definition is a charge usually brought

2980
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:43,800
against someone who helps in the

2981
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:47,439

person charged with these CRI crimes is

2984
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:54,399
usually not present when the crime

2985
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:57,120
itself is committed but they have

2986
02:44:54,399 --> 02:44:59,160
knowledge of the crime before or after

2987
02:44:57,120 --> 02:45:02,640
the fact and may assist in its

2988
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:06,080
commission through advice actions or

2989
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:08,560

crime without taking part of

2994
02:45:16,120 --> 02:45:23,439
it our example sentences they were

2996
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:30,399

03:03:53,200 --> 03:04:00,880
humans are included in the homicide

3370
03:03:57,200 --> 03:04:04,520
definition many homicides such as murder

3371

and manslaughter violate criminal laws

3372
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:10,520

illegal killings range from manslaughter

3375
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:18,200
to murder with multiple degrees of each

3377
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:21,920
crime let's take a look at these in

3378
03:04:20,720 --> 03:04:25,479
closer

3379
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:30,359
detail there is first deegree

3380
03:04:25,479 --> 03:04:33,680
murder repeat after me first deegree

3381
03:04:30,359 --> 03:04:36,399

3382
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:39,239
homicide typically first-degree murder

3383
03:04:36,399 --> 03:04:41,840
is both intentional and

3384
03:04:39,239 --> 03:04:44,120
premeditated premeditated means an

3385
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:45,760
action which is thought of and planned

3386
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:48,560
in

3387
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:51,200
advance premeditated in regards to

3388
03:04:48,560 --> 03:04:53,800
murder can mean anything from a longtime

3389
03:04:51,200 --> 03:04:56,399
plan to kill the victim to a shorter

3390
03:04:53,800 --> 03:04:58,760
term plan the intent of the accused

3391
03:04:56,399 --> 03:05:01,600
murderer does not need to be focused on

3392
03:04:58,760 --> 03:05:04,120
the actual victim if someone planned on

3393
03:05:01,600 --> 03:05:06,479
killing one victim but by accident

3394
03:05:04,120 --> 03:05:09,279
killed someone else the murder is still

3395
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:11,200
intentional and premeditated meaning a

3396
03:05:09,279 --> 03:05:15,200
first-degree murder

3397
03:05:11,200 --> 03:05:18,560
charge next up we have second degree

3398
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:21,200
murder second degree murder

3399
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:23,600
murder when there is a lack of

3400
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:26,439
premeditation but the killer intended to

3401
03:05:23,600 --> 03:05:28,920
kill the homicide May draw second

3402
03:05:26,439 --> 03:05:31,239
deegree murder charges or perhaps

3403
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:35,319
voluntary manslaughter

3404
03:05:31,239 --> 03:05:39,720

kill anyone but still killed the victim

3412
03:05:55,680 --> 03:06:01,319
through behavior that was either

3413
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:04,439
criminally negligent or reckless in

3414
03:06:01,319 --> 03:06:07,239
contrast voluntary manslaughter usually

3415
03:06:04,439 --> 03:06:10,080
means that the offender did not have a

3416
03:06:07,239 --> 03:06:13,080
prior intent to kill such as when the

3417
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:15,720

3418
03:06:13,080 --> 03:06:17,840

English Pro in this video we will be

3479
03:09:21,479 --> 03:09:26,680
reviewing and learning more English

3480
03:09:23,319 --> 03:09:29,239
vocabulary relating to Crime okay let's

3481
03:09:26,680 --> 03:09:32,160
get started our first term is the crime

3482
03:09:29,239 --> 03:09:34,720
of money laundering let's check out the

3483
03:09:32,160 --> 03:09:36,960
definition this is transferring money

3484
03:09:34,720 --> 03:09:39,640
derived from any criminal activity like

3485
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:41,960
a bank robbery into seemingly legitimate

3486
03:09:39,640 --> 03:09:44,840
channels like a bank account or

3487
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:47,520
investment money from a bank robbery is

3488
03:09:44,840 --> 03:09:49,479
considered dirty money so by putting

3489
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:52,399
into a bank account you are making the

3490
03:09:49,479 --> 03:09:55,120
money clean again our next term is the

3491
03:09:52,399 --> 03:09:57,600
crime of

3492
03:09:55,120 --> 03:10:00,120
perjury to commit perjury is to

3493
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:03,399
knowingly make misleading or false

3494
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:05,560
statements under oath or to sign a legal

3495
03:10:03,399 --> 03:10:08,080
document you know to be false or

3496
03:10:05,560 --> 03:10:10,239
misleading this crime is taken very

3497
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:13,040
seriously because the foundation of the

3498
03:10:10,239 --> 03:10:15,279
legal system depends on trust and

3499
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:18,160
credibility if you commit this crime you

3500
03:10:15,279 --> 03:10:21,479
are called a perjurer and and we also

3501
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:24,319
have an idiom to purger oneself to

3502
03:10:21,479 --> 03:10:28,399
purger is the verb form so we could say

3503
03:10:24,319 --> 03:10:31,680
John purered himself in court today and

3504
03:10:28,399 --> 03:10:34,359
moving right along our next term is

3505
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:36,399
probation the definition of probation is

3506
03:10:34,359 --> 03:10:39,120
the release of an offender from

3507
03:10:36,399 --> 03:10:41,640
detention subject to a period of good

3508
03:10:39,120 --> 03:10:45,279
behavior under supervision so that

3509
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:48,560
brings us to the crime of probation

3510
03:10:45,279 --> 03:10:50,800
violation this is an offense that occurs

3511
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:53,120
when you break the terms or conditions

3512
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:54,920
of your probation let's take a look at

3513
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:55,640
the reasons why someone might violate

3514
03:10:54,920 --> 03:10:58,080
their

3515
03:10:55,640 --> 03:11:00,200
probation they might violate for not

3516
03:10:58,080 --> 03:11:03,520
appearing during a scheduled court

3517
03:11:00,200 --> 03:11:06,040
appearance on a set date and time or for

3518
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:08,840
not reporting to your probation officer

3519
03:11:06,040 --> 03:11:11,399
at the scheduled time or place it could

3520
03:11:08,840 --> 03:11:13,800
be for visiting certain people or places

3521
03:11:11,399 --> 03:11:16,160
or traveling out of state without the

3522
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:19,120
permission of your probation officer it

3523
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:21,720
could also be for for possessing using

3524
03:11:19,120 --> 03:11:24,200
or selling illegal drugs or committing

3525
03:11:21,720 --> 03:11:27,080
other crimes or offenses or getting

3526
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:29,439
arrested for another offense so if

3527
03:11:27,080 --> 03:11:32,600
you're on probation good behavior is

3528
03:11:29,439 --> 03:11:35,200
essential our next term is the crime of

embezzle

3539
03:12:03,920 --> 03:12:09,160
funds a lot of rackets deal in

3540
03:12:06,479 --> 03:12:13,600

the crucial element a lack of consent

3549
03:12:32,239 --> 03:12:36,960

3550
03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:40,960

1937 let's move on to November where we

4019
03:34:15,720 --> 03:34:21,000
we have two Federal public

4020
03:34:18,399 --> 03:34:24,840

Harvest a big part of Thanksgiving

4035
03:35:02,199 --> 03:35:07,279
Traditions is the family dinner but

4036
03:35:04,920 --> 03:35:09,720
Americans do like their parades and

4037

always a big game on Thanksgiving daying

4040
03:35:15,840 --> 03:35:20,880
let's move on to our last month of the

4041
03:35:18,239 --> 03:35:24,479
year December and our final public

almost every aspect of Our Lives

4211
03:43:16,120 --> 03:43:20,239
in English we say money makes the world

4212
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:22,720
go

4213
03:43:20,239 --> 03:43:26,399
round another word for money you may

4214
03:43:22,720 --> 03:43:28,920
hear is cash and this usually refers to

4215
03:43:26,399 --> 03:43:32,760
physical money you might hear someone

4216
03:43:28,920 --> 03:43:34,880
say I have some cash in my pocket cash

4217
03:43:32,760 --> 03:43:36,640
can also refer to small amounts of

4218
03:43:34,880 --> 03:43:38,720
non-physical money you could hear

4219
03:43:36,640 --> 03:43:41,720
someone ask can you transfer some cash

4220
03:43:38,720 --> 03:43:45,800

money comes in two different forms coin

03:43:45,800 --> 03:43:48,720
and Bank

4223
03:43:49,159 --> 03:43:54,920
notes however becoming more common is

4224
03:43:52,279 --> 03:43:57,520
credit cards and debit

4225
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:59,800
cards we will take a look at debit cards

4226
03:43:57,520 --> 03:44:02,880
later but for now I want to focus on

4227
03:43:59,800 --> 03:44:05,399
this important word credit the

4228
03:44:02,880 --> 03:44:08,199
definition of credit is the ability of a

4229
03:44:05,399 --> 03:44:11,040
customer to obtain goods or services

4230
03:44:08,199 --> 03:44:15,159
before payment based on the trust that

4231
03:44:11,040 --> 03:44:16,960
payment will be made in the future

4232
03:44:15,159 --> 03:44:19,319
another way to talk about credit is to

4233
03:44:16,960 --> 03:44:22,760
say that it is money that you borrow and

4234
03:44:19,319 --> 03:44:23,640
are usually charged interest on but what

4235
03:44:22,760 --> 03:44:26,680
is

4236
03:44:23,640 --> 03:44:29,120
interest interest is the charge for the

4237
03:44:26,680 --> 03:44:31,600
privilege of borrowing money the amount

4238
03:44:29,120 --> 03:44:33,600
of Interest charged is usually called

4239
03:44:31,600 --> 03:44:36,479
the interest

4240
03:44:33,600 --> 03:44:40,720
rate something which you are commonly

4241
03:44:36,479 --> 03:44:43,239
charged interest on is called a loan a

4242
03:44:40,720 --> 03:44:45,760
loan is a sum of money that is expected

4243
03:44:43,239 --> 03:44:48,359
to be paid back with interest

4244
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:49,359
interest let's use some of these words

4245
03:44:48,359 --> 03:44:52,479
in a

4246
03:44:49,359 --> 03:44:54,600
sentence we needed some credit so we got

4247
03:44:52,479 --> 03:44:56,319
a loan from the bank with a good

4248
03:44:54,600 --> 03:45:00,080
interest

4249
03:44:56,319 --> 03:45:03,319
rate so what kind of loans can you take

4250
03:45:00,080 --> 03:45:05,760
out from the bank let's have a little

4251
03:45:03,319 --> 03:45:09,319
look at three types of loans you may

4252
03:45:05,760 --> 03:45:12,439
commonly take out in your lifetime when

4253
03:45:09,319 --> 03:45:15,199
you need a loan to buy a house we call

4254
03:45:12,439 --> 03:45:19,920
this loan a mortgage

4255
03:45:15,199 --> 03:45:19,920
the t is silent

4256
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:24,860
mortgage another common loan is a

4257
03:45:23,560 --> 03:45:26,000
student

4258
03:45:24,860 --> 03:45:30,640
[Music]

4259
03:45:26,000 --> 03:45:33,520
loan and many people get a car loan to

4260
03:45:30,640 --> 03:45:37,720
purchase a new

4261
03:45:33,520 --> 03:45:39,680
car when people have a lot of money we

4262
03:45:37,720 --> 03:45:41,560
have certain words we use to describe

4263
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:45,520
them like

4264
03:45:41,560 --> 03:45:48,680
wealthy or Rich

4265
03:45:45,520 --> 03:45:51,880
or you can say someone is very well

4266
03:45:48,680 --> 03:45:54,840
off when you have lots of money you can

4267
03:45:51,880 --> 03:45:57,199
buy lots of expensive things and in

4268
03:45:54,840 --> 03:45:59,279
English we say that the wealthy have

4269
03:45:57,199 --> 03:46:02,680
comfortable

4270
03:45:59,279 --> 03:46:04,760
lives but we all need to ask can money

4271
03:46:02,680 --> 03:46:07,560
buy you

4272
03:46:04,760 --> 03:46:11,399
happiness if you don't have a lot of

4273
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:14,319
money you might be described as poor or

4274
03:46:11,399 --> 03:46:15,680
broke or someone might say that you are

4275
03:46:14,319 --> 03:46:18,560
badly

4276
03:46:15,680 --> 03:46:21,120
off people who don't have much money

4277
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:24,080
might have to live on a budget and they

4278
03:46:21,120 --> 03:46:27,199
may have stressful lives which can

4279
03:46:24,080 --> 03:46:29,720
affect health and

4280
03:46:27,199 --> 03:46:31,439
well-being okay let's move on and have a

4281
03:46:29,720 --> 03:46:33,439
look at some new different words for

4282
03:46:31,439 --> 03:46:36,600
money and how we may use

4283
03:46:33,439 --> 03:46:40,040
them a word I'm sure everyone around the

4284
03:46:36,600 --> 03:46:42,479

4472
03:55:33,239 --> 03:55:38,600

4477
03:55:47,439 --> 03:55:52,600
let's take a closer look at this word

4478
03:55:49,880 --> 03:55:56,640
charge which is a noun and the

4479
03:55:52,600 --> 03:56:00,040

important words savings save and

interest so let's take a closer look at

4528
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:13,439
save first and we'll come back to the

4529
03:58:10,279 --> 03:58:15,399
other two save is a verb and it means to

month let's move on to our next word

4536
03:58:29,399 --> 03:58:35,159
which is saving this is the Geren or

4537
03:58:32,600 --> 03:58:38,359
present participle tense of the verb

4538
03:58:35,159 --> 03:58:39,800
save as an example we could say I am

4539
03:58:38,359 --> 03:58:42,880
saving my

4540
03:58:39,800 --> 03:58:46,040

in my bank

4546
03:58:55,680 --> 03:59:01,560
account the next word we're going to

4547
03:58:57,920 --> 03:59:03,840
look at is interest so what is

4548
03:59:01,560 --> 03:59:06,319
interest let's take a look at the

4549
03:59:03,840 --> 03:59:09,040
definition interest is Money Paid

4550
03:59:06,319 --> 03:59:12,159
regularly at a particular rate for the

4551
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:15,040
use of money given as a loan or

4552
03:59:12,159 --> 03:59:17,640
credit there are two ways to think about

4553
03:59:15,040 --> 03:59:21,319
interest it is money the bank will

4554
03:59:17,640 --> 03:59:24,279
charge you on a loan or on an

4555
03:59:21,319 --> 03:59:26,960
overdraft but it is also what we call

4556
03:59:24,279 --> 03:59:29,920
the money the bank will pay you on

4557
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:32,840
savings and Investments so one person

4558
03:59:29,920 --> 03:59:34,279
may say my bank charged me a lot of

4559
03:59:32,840 --> 03:59:37,600
interest on my

4560
03:59:34,279 --> 03:59:41,479
overdraft while another may say I earned

4561
03:59:37,600 --> 03:59:43,720
some money from the interest on my

4562
03:59:41,479 --> 03:59:46,800
savings can you believe that brings us

helpful in this English lesson we'll be

5775
04:59:40,718 --> 04:59:45,920
taking a look at some intermediate

5776
04:59:42,798 --> 04:59:48,160
banking terms these terms are a little

5777
04:59:45,920 --> 04:59:50,360
bit more advanced but I will break them

5778
04:59:48,160 --> 04:59:52,440
down for you in the following ways for

5779
04:59:50,360 --> 04:59:54,920
each of the 15 banking terms you'll

5780
04:59:52,440 --> 04:59:57,718

04:59:54,920 --> 04:59:59,760
definitions and example sentences so

5782
04:59:57,718 --> 05:00:03,680
with all of that business out of the way

5783
04:59:59,760 --> 05:00:07,240
let's begin our lesson on banking

5784
05:00:03,680 --> 05:00:09,520
terms our first term is mortgage now

5785
05:00:07,240 --> 05:00:12,320
this word has a silent T which I've

5786
05:00:09,520 --> 05:00:15,320
highlighted in the word let's check our

5787
05:00:12,320 --> 05:00:15,320
pronunciation

5788
05:00:16,000 --> 05:00:22,440
mortgage a mortgage is like a long-term

5789
05:00:19,240 --> 05:00:24,798
loan specifically for buying property

5790
05:00:22,440 --> 05:00:26,798
when you get a mortgage the bank lends

5791
05:00:24,798 --> 05:00:29,160
you the money to buy a house or

5792
05:00:26,798 --> 05:00:33,240
apartment and you agree to pay it back

5793
05:00:29,160 --> 05:00:35,440
over many years often 15 to 30 the

5794
05:00:33,240 --> 05:00:37,600
property itself serves as security for

5795
05:00:35,440 --> 05:00:39,600
the loan which means if you can't make

5796
05:00:37,600 --> 05:00:40,840
the payments the bank could take the

5797
05:00:39,600 --> 05:00:43,040
property

5798
05:00:40,840 --> 05:00:44,718
back let's move on and take a look at

5799
05:00:43,040 --> 05:00:47,480
our example

5800
05:00:44,718 --> 05:00:49,638
sentence after years of saving for a

5801
05:00:47,480 --> 05:00:52,798
down payment we're finally applying for

5802
05:00:49,638 --> 05:00:57,240
a mortgage to buy our dream

5803
05:00:52,798 --> 05:01:00,600
home our second term is equity repeat

5804
05:00:57,240 --> 05:01:00,600
after me

5805
05:01:01,160 --> 05:01:06,638
Equity think of equity as your piece of

5806
05:01:04,360 --> 05:01:10,160
a financial

5807
05:01:06,638 --> 05:01:12,760
pie for example if you own a house the

5808
05:01:10,160 --> 05:01:14,680
equity is the part of the House's value

5809
05:01:12,760 --> 05:01:16,400
that you actually own it's the

5810
05:01:14,680 --> 05:01:19,080
difference between the value of the

5811
05:01:16,400 --> 05:01:21,878
property and what you still owe on any

5812
05:01:19,080 --> 05:01:24,718
mortgages Equity can also refer to

5813
05:01:21,878 --> 05:01:26,040
ownership in a company through stocks

5814
05:01:24,718 --> 05:01:28,400
let's move on and take a look at our

5815
05:01:26,040 --> 05:01:31,240
example sentence I've been paying the

5816
05:01:28,400 --> 05:01:34,120
mortgage for 10 years so I've built up

5817
05:01:31,240 --> 05:01:37,240
considerable equity in my

5818
05:01:34,120 --> 05:01:41,840
house our next term is

5819
05:01:37,240 --> 05:01:41,840
collateral repeat after me

5820
05:01:43,440 --> 05:01:48,000
collateral collateral is something

5821
05:01:45,840 --> 05:01:50,958
valuable that you promise to give your

5822
05:01:48,000 --> 05:01:52,878
lender if you can't pay back a loan it's

5823
05:01:50,958 --> 05:01:55,718
like saying if I can't pay you back in

5824
05:01:52,878 --> 05:01:58,520
cash you can take this item instead

5825
05:01:55,718 --> 05:02:02,360
common examples of collateral include

5826
05:01:58,520 --> 05:02:04,360
houses cars or other valuable assets it

5827
05:02:02,360 --> 05:02:06,878
gives the lender assurance that they

5828
05:02:04,360 --> 05:02:09,000
will recover their money one way or

5829
05:02:06,878 --> 05:02:11,000
another so let's take this word

5830
05:02:09,000 --> 05:02:13,558
collateral and use it in an example

5831
05:02:11,000 --> 05:02:17,558
sentence to secure the loan for my

5832
05:02:13,558 --> 05:02:20,520
business I offered my vintage car as

5833
05:02:17,558 --> 05:02:23,680
collateral our fourth banking term is

5834
05:02:20,520 --> 05:02:28,680

5835
05:02:23,680 --> 05:02:28,680
the pronunciation perfect Asset

5836
05:02:29,360 --> 05:02:34,320
Management asset management is all about

5837
05:02:31,958 --> 05:02:36,958
a professional managing your money and

5838
05:02:34,320 --> 05:02:38,920
Investments think of an asset manager as

5839
05:02:36,958 --> 05:02:40,958
a financial Chef they take your

5840
05:02:38,920 --> 05:02:43,558
ingredients like savings stocks and

5841
05:02:40,958 --> 05:02:46,160
bonds and cook up a plan to help your

5842
05:02:43,558 --> 05:02:50,280
wealth grow over time keeping in mind

5843
05:02:46,160 --> 05:02:50,280
your financial goals and risk

5844
05:02:50,718 --> 05:02:56,040
tolerance since I'm not an expert in

5845
05:02:53,400 --> 05:02:58,320
stocks and bonds I rely on Asset

5846
05:02:56,040 --> 05:03:00,320
Management Services to handle my

5847
05:02:58,320 --> 05:03:02,680

portfolio later in the lesson let's move

5850
05:03:05,600 --> 05:03:11,480
on to diversification repeat after me

5851
05:03:09,080 --> 05:03:16,958
divers

5852
05:03:11,480 --> 05:03:16,958
ification let's try it one more time

5853
05:03:19,840 --> 05:03:25,040
diversification diversification in

5854
05:03:22,320 --> 05:03:28,080
banking is like not putting all your

5855
05:03:25,040 --> 05:03:30,280
eggs in one basket it's spreading your

5856
05:03:28,080 --> 05:03:34,200
Investments across different types of

5857
05:03:30,280 --> 05:03:37,440
assets stocks bonds real estate Etc to

5858
05:03:34,200 --> 05:03:39,840
reduce risk if one investment performs

5859
05:03:37,440 --> 05:03:41,320
poorly others might do well and buy

5860
05:03:39,840 --> 05:03:43,798
balance things

5861
05:03:41,320 --> 05:03:47,160
out our example

5862
05:03:43,798 --> 05:03:49,600
sentences my financial advisor suggested

5863
05:03:47,160 --> 05:03:52,280
diversification of my investments to

5864
05:03:49,600 --> 05:03:55,840
protect against Market

5865
05:03:52,280 --> 05:04:00,160
swings our sixth term is

5866
05:03:55,840 --> 05:04:03,520
liability repeat after me

5867
05:04:00,160 --> 05:04:06,600
liability in banking a liability is

5868
05:04:03,520 --> 05:04:09,440
essentially any money you owe this could

5869
05:04:06,600 --> 05:04:12,320
be a Loan mortgage or even money you've

5870
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:15,120
PR promise to pay in the future it's an

5871
05:04:12,320 --> 05:04:17,360
obligation you're legally required to

5872
05:04:15,120 --> 05:04:21,798
fulfill understanding your liabilities

5873
05:04:17,360 --> 05:04:21,798

liability our seventh banking term is

5877
05:04:31,000 --> 05:04:37,480
credit rating repeat after me credit

5878
05:04:37,878 --> 05:04:43,840
rating your credit r rating is a score

5879
05:04:41,160 --> 05:04:46,480
that tells lenders how good you are at

5880
05:04:43,840 --> 05:04:49,520
paying back money you've borrowed it's

5881
05:04:46,480 --> 05:04:51,638
like a report card for your finances a

5882
05:04:49,520 --> 05:04:54,360
high credit rating means you're a

5883
05:04:51,638 --> 05:04:57,120
lowrisk borrower which can help you get

5884
05:04:54,360 --> 05:04:59,958
loans with better interest rates on the

5885
05:04:57,120 --> 05:05:03,638
other hand a low credit rating can make

5886
05:04:59,958 --> 05:05:06,920
borrowing more expensive or even

5887
05:05:03,638 --> 05:05:09,638
impossible let's check out our example

5888
05:05:06,920 --> 05:05:12,520
sentence I'm working to improve my

5889
05:05:09,638 --> 05:05:15,760
credit rating by paying bills on time

5890
05:05:12,520 --> 05:05:20,000
and reducing my debt let's check out the

5891
05:05:15,760 --> 05:05:23,000
pronunciation of our next term

5892
05:05:20,000 --> 05:05:23,000
principal

5893
05:05:23,440 --> 05:05:29,200
principle in the context of banking the

5894
05:05:26,480 --> 05:05:31,798
principle is the original sum of money

5895
05:05:29,200 --> 05:05:33,920
borrowed in a loan or the amount of the

5896
05:05:31,798 --> 05:05:36,638
investment it doesn't include the

5897
05:05:33,920 --> 05:05:38,840
interest or additional fees so when you

5898
05:05:36,638 --> 05:05:40,878
start repaying a loan part of your

5899
05:05:38,840 --> 05:05:44,200
payments go go towards reducing the

5900
05:05:40,878 --> 05:05:47,240
principal and part go towards the

5901
05:05:44,200 --> 05:05:49,680
interest over time as I keep making

5902
05:05:47,240 --> 05:05:52,200
payments on my car loan the principal

5903
05:05:49,680 --> 05:05:52,200
amount

5904
05:05:52,558 --> 05:05:59,040
decreases our ninth term is annual

5905
05:05:55,920 --> 05:06:05,120
percentage rate often referred to as AP

5906
05:05:59,040 --> 05:06:05,120
or so we have annual percentage rate or

5907
05:06:06,000 --> 05:06:12,558
apor AP or is like the true cost of

5908
05:06:09,680 --> 05:06:15,200
borrowing money expressed as a yearly

5909
05:06:12,558 --> 05:06:17,718
interest rate it includes not just the

5910
05:06:15,200 --> 05:06:20,718
interest rate but also any additional

5911
05:06:17,718 --> 05:06:23,160
fees or charges associated with the loan

5912
05:06:20,718 --> 05:06:25,760
so it's a more complete picture of what

5913
05:06:23,160 --> 05:06:29,680
you'll actually

5914
05:06:25,760 --> 05:06:32,798
pay when comparing Loan offers I always

5915
05:06:29,680 --> 05:06:34,760
check the APR to understand the full

5916
05:06:32,798 --> 05:06:37,920
cost of

5917
05:06:34,760 --> 05:06:41,000
borrowing another important banking term

5918
05:06:37,920 --> 05:06:45,558
is compound interest

5919
05:06:41,000 --> 05:06:48,160
repeat after me compound

5920
05:06:45,558 --> 05:06:51,200
interest compound interest is when you

5921
05:06:48,160 --> 05:06:54,120
earn interest not just on your initial

5922
05:06:51,200 --> 05:06:56,600
investment or principle but also on the

5923
05:06:54,120 --> 05:06:59,480
interest that has been added to it over

5924
05:06:56,600 --> 05:07:01,760
time it's like your savings growing

5925
05:06:59,480 --> 05:07:06,558
exponentially because the interest you

5926
05:07:01,760 --> 05:07:09,798
earn each year also starts earning

5927
05:07:06,558 --> 05:07:12,240
interest thanks to compound interest my

5928
05:07:09,798 --> 05:07:14,320
savings account balance has grown more

5929
05:07:12,240 --> 05:07:16,480
than I had initially

5930
05:07:14,320 --> 05:07:19,440
calculated let's move on to our next

5931
05:07:16,480 --> 05:07:23,718
term which is liquid

5932
05:07:19,440 --> 05:07:27,120
assets repeat after me liquid

5933
05:07:23,718 --> 05:07:29,200
assets liquid assets are things you own

5934
05:07:27,120 --> 05:07:32,120
that can be quickly and easily turned

5935
05:07:29,200 --> 05:07:34,200
into Cash without losing value this

5936
05:07:32,120 --> 05:07:36,558
includes things like money in savings

5937
05:07:34,200 --> 05:07:39,200
accounts or stocks that can be sold on

5938
05:07:36,558 --> 05:07:41,240
short notice they're called liquid

5939
05:07:39,200 --> 05:07:43,718
because because they can flow easily

5940
05:07:41,240 --> 05:07:46,638
into

5941
05:07:43,718 --> 05:07:50,760
cash I always keep a portion of my

5942
05:07:46,638 --> 05:07:52,680
investments in liquid assets for

5943
05:07:50,760 --> 05:07:55,200
emergencies next up we're going to look

5944
05:07:52,680 --> 05:07:58,798
at two different types of interest rate

5945
05:07:55,200 --> 05:08:03,440
first up we have fixed interest rate

5946
05:07:58,798 --> 05:08:06,638
repeat after me fixed interest

5947
05:08:03,440 --> 05:08:08,798
rate a fixed interest rate means the

5948
05:08:06,638 --> 05:08:12,160
interest rate on your loan or savings

5949
05:08:08,798 --> 05:08:14,718
account won't change over a set period

5950
05:08:12,160 --> 05:08:17,080
it's predictable like a fixed menu in a

5951
05:08:14,718 --> 05:08:19,320
restaurant you know exactly what you're

5952
05:08:17,080 --> 05:08:20,798
getting and what it will cost you with

5953
05:08:19,320 --> 05:08:24,160
no

5954
05:08:20,798 --> 05:08:27,280
surprises our example sentences I chose

5955
05:08:24,160 --> 05:08:30,240
a loan with a fixed interest rate so my

5956
05:08:27,280 --> 05:08:33,080
monthly repayments will stay the same

5957
05:08:30,240 --> 05:08:36,280
the other type of interest rate is a

5958
05:08:33,080 --> 05:08:40,240
variable interest rate repeat after me

5959
05:08:36,280 --> 05:08:43,400
variable interest rate

5960
05:08:40,240 --> 05:08:46,040
in contrast to the fixed interest rate a

5961
05:08:43,400 --> 05:08:49,558
variable interest rate can change over

5962
05:08:46,040 --> 05:08:51,558
time based on the market or an index

5963
05:08:49,558 --> 05:08:54,280
it's a bit like the weather sometimes

5964
05:08:51,558 --> 05:08:57,440
it's sunny rates go down and sometimes

5965
05:08:54,280 --> 05:09:00,920
it's rainy rates go up this can affect

5966
05:08:57,440 --> 05:09:03,840
your loan payments or savings

5967
05:09:00,920 --> 05:09:06,160
earnings my mortgage has a variable

5968
05:09:03,840 --> 05:09:09,440
interest rate so my payments might

5969
05:09:06,160 --> 05:09:12,480
fluctuate over the years our penultimate
